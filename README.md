# Awesome I2P

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of awesome I2P implementations, libraries, resources, projects, and shiny things. Inspired by [awesome-tor](https://github.com/ajvb/awesome-tor) and [awesome-cpp](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp) and other awesome lists.

### What is I2P?
I2P is an anonymous overlay network - a network within a network. It is intended to protect communication from dragnet surveillance and monitoring by third parties such as ISPs.
I2P is used by many people who care about their privacy: activists, oppressed people, journalists and whistleblowers, as well as the average person.

## Projects using I2P

* [I2P-Bote](https://i2pbote.xyz/) - I2P-Bote is a plugin for I2P that allows users to send and receive emails while preserving privacy. It does not need a mail server because emails are stored in a distributed hash table. They are automatically encrypted and digitally signed, which ensures no one but the intended recipient can read the email, and third parties cannot forge them.
